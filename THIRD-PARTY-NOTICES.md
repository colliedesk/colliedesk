## Knowledge base editor (web, its own chunk)

The article editor (`web/src/features/kb/editor/`) is built on CodeMirror 6. Its chunk holds exactly
these packages (read from the build's source map):

| Package | Version | License | Copyright |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `@codemirror/commands`, `@codemirror/language`, `@codemirror/search`, `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view` | 6.10.1, 6.13.1, 6.7.2, 6.7.6, 6.43.15 | MIT | Copyright (C) 2018-2021 by Marijn Haverbeke and others |
| `@lezer/common`, `@lezer/highlight`, `@lezer/markdown` | 1.5.3, 1.2.5, 1.8.0 | MIT | Copyright (C) 2018, 2020 by Marijn Haverbeke and others |
| `style-mod`, `w3c-keyname`, `crelt`, `@marijn/find-cluster-break` | 4.1.4, 2.2.8, 1.0.7, 1.0.4 | MIT | Copyright (C) 2016-2024 by Marijn Haverbeke and others |

The preview beside it uses `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` with the unified, mdast and micromark
packages they depend on (MIT, Copyright (c) Titus Wormer and the unified collective;
`escape-string-regexp`: Copyright (c) Sindre Sorhus).
